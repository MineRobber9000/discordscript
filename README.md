# DiscordScript

Where to begin with this mess I've made? I guess I'll start by describing where it all began.

August 24th, 2020. I see a tumblr post where someone's complaining about pool, and after some discussion with friends in a private server, I set out to recreate this tumblr post as a Discord screenshot. I go all out; avatars stolen from emojis in the server (with the exception of Shadow, for whom I used his crest from his game), nicknames that are either puns or references, and I got all of the spacing and alignment as correct as I possibly could.

Over the next week, I make more of these memes. The straw that broke the camel's back, however, was a JoJo meme. 29 messages, all painstakingly hand-placed and hand-aligned for all 29 of the messages in it. It was at that point that I decided I needed to write a program...

...but it would be 5 more days until I actually sat down and wrote it. After some editing, I ended up with this, a Discord meme generator. Write a script to the specifications, run it through `tojson.py`, and then through `compilejson.py`, and you get out a perfectly aligned, perfectly spaced Discord meme. No more spending 2 hours in Photopea over a silly JoJo joke, just type, run, and enjoy!

Information on the script and character info formats can be found in `SCRIPT_FORMAT.md` and `CHARINFO_FORMAT.md` respectively.
