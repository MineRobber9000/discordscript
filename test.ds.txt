after having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, i usually have no problems sleeping until morning
just like a baby, i wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning

Zero what the hell are you doing

i take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night
== SILVER
i swear to Chaos, Zero
it's too early in the morning for this

if i were to fight i wouldn't lose to anyone
