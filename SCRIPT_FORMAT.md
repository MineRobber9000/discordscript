# DiscordScript format

The DiscordScript format is easy to understand. It's based on how I typed out the script for the JoJo meme in a notepad document.

The extension recommended is ".ds.txt".

To declare somebody who's speaking, simply put (on its own line) two equals signs, then a space, followed by the character's name in all-caps.

```
== CHARACTER ONE
This is some riveting example message dialogue we have going on here!
== CHARACTER TWO
I know, right? A perfect example on how the script format works!
```

Any lines of text between these equal-sign delimiters is considered to be a message sent by that person. When simulating ultiple messages being sent in quick succession, just use newlines between each message. The spacing will be a little off but nobody will really care because it gets the message across.
